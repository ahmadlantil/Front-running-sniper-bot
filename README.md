## What is a FrontRunning Bot?

Front running bots are bots that have the ability to anticipate a big transaction that is going to change the token price, sometimes going up to 100%. By executing trades before the transaction is made public, the bot can take advantage of the price increase and generate profits.

## How to Run the FrontRunning Bot

To run the front running bot, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node.js

If you don't already have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

### Step 2: Install NPM Dependencies

Once you have Node.js installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure the Bot

The bot can be configured by editing the bot.js file. There are two variables that need to be edited:

<code>var wss = "wss://your-fastlynode-url"</code>: This variable should be replaced with the WebSocket node URL that you want to use. You can obtain this URL from [FastlyNode](https://fastlynode.com/).

<code>const secretKey = "your secret key"</code>: This variable should be replaced with your secret key, which can be obtained from a web3 wallet like MetaMask. Be sure to keep your secret key safe and secure.

### Step 4: Run the Bot

To run the bot, execute the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
